## 🚀 Project Overview

SpinFlow is all about creating an exciting visual experience with **roller skates** as the theme! From spinning elements to smooth scrolling banners, this project is packed with vibrant colors and animations. It's a playful and modern interface that brings life to the world of roller skating.

What will you find in this project?
- 🌀 **Scrolling banners** that roll just like skates!
- ✨ **Dynamic buttons** with fun hover effects.
- 🌟 **CSS keyframe animations** for elements that pop, spin, and shine.
- 📸 **Photo gallery** showing off user-generated content with animation effects.
  
## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The primary goal of SpinFlow is to **practice CSS animations** in a real-world project scenario. Here's what I aim to learn and demonstrate:
1. **Keyframe animations** in CSS.
2. **Smooth scrolling** effects with just CSS.
3. Building an **interactive user interface** that stays fun.
4. How to combine design, creativity, and functionality.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was built with:
- **HTML5** - For the structure and content.
- **CSS3** - For all the magic animations, transitions, and styling.
- **Google Fonts** - Because typography is also so important! I'm using `Inter`, `Montserrat`, and `Syne`.

## 🎨 Key Features

- **Hero Section**: A playful introduction with rotating words like "daring", "fun", and "healthy" to make the page feel alive.
  
- **Smooth Banner Scroller**: A continuous scroll of text that mimics the motion of roller skates – yeah, no JavaScript, just CSS power!

- **Vibrant Buttons**: A call-to-action with buttons that catch your eye and animate on hover.

- **Interactive Photo Gallery**: A showcase of skate moments from the community with zoom effects and hover states.

- **Footer with Social Links**: Let's stay connected! Follow SpinFlow on Instagram, YouTube, and more.

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility
